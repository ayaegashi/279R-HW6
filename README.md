# 279R HW6: To-Do List App using Meteor and Svelte

## Reflection

#### What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

This to-do list app was created by following this online tutorial: https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/

In order to create the strike-through effect for completed tasks, I also referenced this answer on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67327845/flask-python-add-strikethrough-styling-to-todo-list-item-in-flask-app

## How to Open my To-Do List App

Using the green Code button, clone or download the code from this repository. From your command line, access the code's folder.

Install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, which are used by the app, by running the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install Flask
$ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

To open the app, run:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

(Note that you can do the same using pip3 and python3.)
